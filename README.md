Welcome to my site for Modeling Multimodal AI 2026.
This repo contains my homework assignments and random thoughts throughout the class.

## Bio
<img src="./imgs/profile.png" style="width:200px;">

hi i’m valdemar. i arrived at MIT through a series of poor containment decisions involving curiosity and the internet. i do research on AI and human thinking which mostly means building experimental systems that refuse to let people intellectually vibe through life unchecked. i like making art / physical things and music. sometimes i produces papers. 

## Final Project
For my final project I created a brainrot optimized multi-modal generator (text, video, audio, tactile brainrot).
